This that I learned along the way.

1.  Semantic elements: 
        element that clearly describes it's meaning to both the browser and the developer
        semantic elments include <form>, <table>, <article>, <header>, <main>, etc.
        when semantic elements are used the browser renders the element in particula way relevant to the element, for example <header> is always rendered before <main> irrespective of the position in the code.
        elements like <div> and <span> are called non-semantic elements.

2.  Open link in new tab:
        This can be done by adding target="_blank" to the <a> element. Along with this rel-"noopener noreferrer" should be added to the element to compensate a vulnerability.
        adding rel="noopener noreferrer" to links protects your site's users against having the site you've linked to potentially hijacking the browser (via rogue JS).

3.  adding css in *{} :
        Only a minimumum number of attributes should be added this as these attributes will be rendered to every element which might impact the performance significantly.
